<h2>MORE ABOUT ME</h2>

    <summary>My background</summary>
    <p><font size="5">You can call me Yoshikage Kira. 
        I'm currently 33 years old. 
        Not that you'd care, but I reside in northeast Morioh's villa district. 
        Also, I've yet to marry. In order to make a living, I work for Kame Yu department stores.
         After a long day's work, I return home no later than 8 PM. 
         I don't like smoking, but do enjoy the occasional drink. 
         I'm always in bed by 11 PM, and I make it a point to get no less than 8 hours of sleep each night. 
         Before bed, I drink a warm glass of milk. It's always coupled with 20 minutes of stretching to decompress from the long workday. 
         Sweet dreams are the usual result of this.
        <br>
        I then awake as refreshed and recharged as a newborn child, ready to take on the day's challenges. 
        And after my last checkup, I was given a clean bill of health. 
        For as long as I could remember, I've done everything in my power to live a productive life that allows me to pursue a lasting inner peace. 
        This may be a foreign concept, but I choose not to concern myself with winning or losing, life's troubles, or enemies who bring sleepless nights.
        That is how I cope with this backwards life we find ourselves living. 
        It's what brings me happiness in a world fraught with hardship and misery. 
        Of course, if I were ever to engage in combat, I would win the battle without question.</font></p>
